# express-ts-starter
Starter kit for ExpressJS in TypeScript

A simple starter project for all those who would like to begin their adventure with NodeJS / ExpressJS and Typescript.

### What's included 
1. Code generated from express-generator moved to TypeScript
2. Basic build pipeline

### How to use
1. Clone this repo: ``` git clone https://github.com/GasiorowskiPiotr/express-ts-starter.git ```.
2. Install dependencies: ``` npm install ``` (this also installs typings).
3. Run sample: ``` npm run start-win (for Windows)``` or ``` npm run start-linux (for Linux) ```
4. Start watching for source changes and restart Node after recompilation: ``` npm run devenv-win (for Windows)``` or ``` npm run devenv-linux (for Linux) ```

### Plans
1. ~~Use ``` tsc -w ``` to compile on file changes (alongside with ```supervisor ``` to restart Node process after compilation).~~ (done in 0.1.0)
2. CLI - TBD
